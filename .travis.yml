  - $HOME/.lilypond

# Download and install LilyPond (stable and devel)
# when not present already (cached between builds)
install:
  - python ./test/install_lilypond.py

# This is the script that will actually run the tests
script: ./test/simple_tests.py

# These are environment variables that are used to configure the

#   - LILY_PLATFORM is the platform for which lilypond was
#                   compiled. Note that travis-ci is running 64 bit
#                   Linux virtual machines, hence `linux-64` is pretty
#                   much the only value that makes sense.
#
#   - LILY_VERSION is the version of lilypond with which we want to
#                  run the tests. "stable" and "devel" are placeholders
#                  for values retrieved from test/LILYPOND-VERSIONS
#                  during the installation and test scripts
env:
  - LILY_PLATFORM=linux-64 LILY_VERSION=stable
  - LILY_PLATFORM=linux-64 LILY_VERSION=devel
