# Reorganization note

**(please remove this note before finally merging the `reorganization` branch).**

We are reorganizating the repository in order to create a more scalable and maintainable library.
One can consider this process finished when all content of the old top-level directories has moved into the new
directory structure:

```
/includes
/library
  /oll
    - includable-files.ily
    /music-fonts
    /stylesheets
      - new structure to be discussed
    /templates
      - new structure to be discussed
/usage-examples
  - documentation-files.ly
```

`/library` should be added to LilyPond's include path so the subdirectories below can be `\include`d
from end-user LilyPond files.  
`/usage-examples` contains documentation examples, exactly one `.ly` file corresponding to the `.ily`
files below `/library/oll`.  
`/includes` will contain files that are needed by any snippets in the library but shouldn't be exposed
to end-user files.

---

Snippets should be moved to the new structure one by one, using pull requests even by team members with
push access.  Before actually moving files we will have to reconsider the metadata structure requirements
because in the future documentation will be auto-generated using that metadata.

---

What's this?
============

A place to store and collaborate on LilyPond tools - snippets, templates, extensions.
Why we don't just put this stuff in [Lilypond Snippet Repository](http://lsr.dsi.unimi.it/)?
There are two reasons:
* Some things cannot be placed in LSR (multi-file extensions, special scripts).
* LSR doesn't have tools for collaboration and version control.

<!---
At some point in the future we may develop a nice web frontend for this repository;
we would also like to integrate it with the core LilyPond project similarly to
how stuff from LSR is imported into official documentation.
We may also move this repository somewhere else, because we dislike the proprietary
nature of GitHub.

Using this repository
=====================

You can view the files in your browser by clicking on their names,
and simply copy&paste the code into your editor. You can also
[download](https://github.com/openlilylib/snippets/archive/master.zip)
the whole repository in a ZIP archive.  This is recommended for casual use.
For regular users, we recommend using [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
to clone the whole repository to your computer.  If you need help with Git,
[contact us](README.md#contact).

Most snippets are divided into an `.ily` file with function definitions and a `.ly`
file showing a usage example.  To use the functions provided by the snippet,
simply `\include` the `.ily` file into your score.

You can make the root directory of the repository available to LilyPond,
e.g. by using the `-I` or `--include=` command line option (or, if you use
Frescobaldi, add the path in _LilyPond preferences_).  
Then you will be able to `\include` the snippets with a path relative to
the repository root directory - for example, 
`\include "debugging-layout/display-grob-anchors/definitions.ily"`
will allow you to use `\printAnchors` function defined in the snippet.
Frescobaldi also supports autocompletion if you have added the repository
in the preferences. So typing `\include "debu` will already give you the
appropriate completion suggestion.


Contributing
============

What's eligible?
----------------

Everything that's useful and isn't totally obvious (rule of thumb:
anything over 20 lines of code is probably worth including).
**You can even contribute work in progress** and update it later.


How to contribute
-----------------

The easiest way to contribute is using GitHub's web interface.

1. Create an account on [GitHub](http://github.com/), log into it.
2. Go to this repository's
[GitHub page](http://github.com/openlilylib/snippets).
3. To add a new file, click on [this button]
(http://raw.github.com/openlilylib/snippets/master/meta/adding-new-file-github-interface.png).
To modify a file, click its name and then click _Edit_.
5. Write what you have changed (form at the bottom)
and click _Commit_.
6. **Don't forget to click** _Send pull request_.
([more info...](meta/contributing.md#pull-requests))

Using more powerful tools for contributing is described
[here](meta/contributing.md#contributing-using-advanced-tools).


Guidelines
----------

_Note: detailed guidelines are in [`meta/contributing.md`]
(meta/contributing.md)(optional reading)._

* Your snippet must compile (even if it's work-in-progress)
and it must contain a `\version` statement.
* Please use a template from [`meta/snippet-templates`]
(meta/snippet-templates) as your starting point:
  - simple snippets that just demonstrate built-in LilyPond features
    should use the one-file template.
  - snippets defining custom commands, functions, engravers etc.
    that can be useful on their own should use the "includable" template.
* If possible, please format your code using Frescobaldi's
_Format_ tool.
* When you make changes in your snippets, please contribute
updates to the repository! :-)


Snippet categories
==================

* [__custom-music-fonts__](custom-music-fonts) -
    alternative fonts for LilyPond, that can be used instead of default Feta.
* [__debugging-layout__](debugging-layout) -
    tools that visualize LilyPond's layout decisions (e.g. directions),
* [__general-tools__](general-tools) -
    stuff for working on and with LilyPond itself.
* [__input-shorthands__](input-shorthands) -
    music functions and other tools that make writing LilyPond code easier,
* [__notation-snippets__](notation-snippets) -
    LilyPond code that produces some particular notation,
* [__simple-examples__](simple-examples) -
    snippets that are just explaining or demonstrating things from the documentation,
* [__specific-solutions__](specific-solutions) -
    hacks that aren't generic, just solve a very specific problem,
* [__stylesheets__](stylesheets) -
    a place for collections of user-designed layout settings ("house styles"),
* [__templates__](templates) -
    examples showing how to structure LilyPond code.

Every category has a `README.md` file inside with more details,
but if you're not sure which category to choose, don't worry!
*It's not that important.*


<!---
Later on, we may divide the snippets into 2 (or more)
"quality levels":
- official ones, showing Recommended LilyPond Practice,
- drafts, hacks etc. that were just written by someone
  and may be useful, but may also not be.

The policy would be to allow anyone to add anything to the "hacks",
but adding/changing official ones (or moving a draft to official ones)
would require some confirmation from someone else (not necessarily
a full review, but at least a quick look).

Update: actually, the status field probably already does this.
