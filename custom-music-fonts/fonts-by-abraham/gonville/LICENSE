Gonville

a font of musical symbols, compatible with GNU Lilypond

Introduction

Gonville is a font of symbols for typesetting music: clefs, note heads, quaver
tails, and so on. It is compatible with GNU Lilypond.

I designed it because Lilypond's standard font (Feta) was not to my taste: I 
found it to be (variously) over-ornate, strangely proportioned, and subtly not 
like the music I was used to reading. Music set in Feta looks to me like 
strangely stylised music; music set in Gonville just looks to me like music, 
so I can read it without being distracted so much.

Unfortunately, at the time of writing this, Lilypond contains no configuration
option to select a different music font, so installing and using Gonville is 
not completely trivial: you have to make a copy of the whole Lilypond data 
directory, replace the fonts within that copy, and then set an environment 
variable pointing to the copied directory. I've tried to make that as easy as 
possible by providing a Unix shell script to construct the modified data 
directory.

What is not supported

Gonville has been tested against Lilypond version 2.10.33 (the version shipped 
in Debian 5.0), 2.12.2 and 2.13.5. It is possible that it will not work 
properly with other versions, if the Lilypond developers choose to add new 
glyphs or change the names under which they expect to find the existing ones. 
I intend to try to keep Gonville up to date; if you find a problem with a 
later version of Lilypond, let me know the details and I'll see what I can do.

There are a few parts of the standard Lilypond font which I have not attempted
to reproduce, so music using those features cannot be typeset in Gonville. The 
missing elements are:

- The longa note (twice as long as a breve). Unused in modern music.
- Ancient music notation: any of Lilypond's non-default styles such as 
  mensural, neomensural, petrucci and so on.
- The set of differently shaped note heads for each note of the scale (enabled 
  using shapeNoteStyles).

Licence

The Gonville font files themselves may be used without restriction. You don't 
even have to preserve a copyright notice or anything. Use freely and enjoy.

In particular, this means that you may embed the Gonville font or portions of
it in PostScript, PDF, SVG or other document file formats without incurring 
any constraint whatsoever on your subsequent use or licensing of those files.

(On the other hand, if you're using the Gonville outlines in a context where 
they might be mistaken for your own work, e.g. incorporating them into a music 
typesetting program, it would be polite to give me credit for the design.)

The source code that generates the font files (if you download the source 
archive below, or look in the Subversion repository) is distributed under the 
MIT licence.

For more details, see the file called LICENCE in the distribution archive.

The Subversion URL you need is svn://svn.tartarus.org/sgt/gonville. So you 
could use a checkout command such as this:

svn co svn://svn.tartarus.org/sgt/gonville

Alternatively, you can browse the Subversion repository on the WWW, here.
