In March 2013 Torsten HÃ¤mmerle sent a wonderful LilyPond add-on to the
lilypond-user mailing list: LilyJAZZ. Read his original announcement in this
message (http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/lilypond-user/2013-03/msg00647.html).
LilyJAZZ offers a JAZZ Music and a JAZZ Text font along with tools to
integrate them in LilyPond.

Disclaimer:
The licensing status of this material isn't completely clear. The original 
developer isn't available and can't be contacted through email or phone 
anymore. Therefore we can only rely on his original post where he states that

We consider this as a release under the same licensing model as LilyPond (i.e. 
GPL). "shall be" is surely not meant as a temporal expression but as an 
expression of intent (it is probably inexactly translated from the German 
"soll sein", not from "wird sein"). Torsten surely meant that having created 
the fonts was the prerequisite for being able to release it under a free 
license, and not that making the material available in that message was the 
prerequisite to release it "open and free" at some undetermined point in 
future.
