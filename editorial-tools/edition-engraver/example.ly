% try rehearsal marks

% Mark is moved, if we don't address Staff (why? it is called more than once?)

\editionMod fullscore 5 2/4 my.test \once \override RehearsalMark.extra-offset.extra-offset = #'(1 . 4)
\editionMod fullscore 7 0/4 my.test \mark \default

% color the notehead red on the second quarter in the second measure
\editionMod fullscore 2 1/4 my.test.alot \once \override NoteHead #'color = #red
% destroy the slur starting on the second quarter in the first measure
\editionMod fullscore 1 2/4 my.test.Staff.A \shape #'((0 . 0)(0 . 1)(0 . -1)(0 . 0)) Slur

% add a break to several times
\editionMMod fullscore #'((2 1/4)) my.test.Score { \bar "" \break } % the empty bar permits break inside measure
% add an annotation in form of a TextScript
\editionMod fullscore 2 0/4 my.test.alot.Melody -\markup { \with-color #red "what's that?" }

% now also ottava is supported (uses context-mod-from-music)
\editionMod fullscore 2 2/4 my.test.Staff \ottava #1
