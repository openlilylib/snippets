# openlilylib/library

This directory is the root directory for the `openlilylib` library.  
To "install" `openlilylib` you should add this directory to LilyPond's include path, either by specifying it directly on the command line, incorporate it into a wrapper script or add it to the paths in Frescobaldi's Preference dialog.

Includable snippets files are located in the `oll` subdirectory and can be included in LilyPond input files through `\include "oll/file-name.ily"`.
