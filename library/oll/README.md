# openlilylib/library/oll

This folder contains all the includable files of the `openlilylib` library.  It is intended that they are
included using `oll/` as a prefix by adding the `library` directory to LilyPond's include path.
The files contain descriptions and some metadata.  For usage examples and further information refer
to the files with the same name in the toplevel directory `usage-examples`
