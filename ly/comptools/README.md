# comptools - Compilation Helpers for GNU LilyPond

This library provides functionality to manipulate the compilation process
of LilyPond scores. This includes partial (re-)compilation, inserting arbitrary 
(e.g. original) line breaks and `edition-engraver`, a general purpose tool to
arbitrarily inject tweaks, commands and content into scores.
