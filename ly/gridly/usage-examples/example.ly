%%%                        Gridly example
%%%                        ==============
%%%
%%% This file illustrate the basic usage of Gridly with a single file.
%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%% Preliminary stuff
%%% -----------------
%%%
%%% First of all, you have to include the file that provides the
%%% public interface
\include "openlilylib"
\loadModule "gridly"

%%% Grid initialization
%%% -------------------
%%%
%%% Then, this is the fundamental setup step. With \gridInit you define
%%% the dimensions of the grid: how many segments it should have and which
%%% parts it contains. In this case we are initializing a grid with
%%% two segments and two parts, namely "soprano" and "basso".
\gridInit 4 #'("soprano"
               "basso")

%%% You can optionally specify the grid "structure", that is, the
%%% defaults for each section, that will be then applied to each
%%% part. The \gridSetStructure command has the following interface:
%%%
%%%    \gridSetStructure segment-index context-modifier music
%%%
%%% where:
%%%
%%%  * `segment-index` selects the segment for which you want to set
%%%                    up the structure
%%%  * `context-modifier` is an optional parameter, that can be used
%%%                       to set the default values for the `lyrics`,
%%%                       the `opening` and the `closing` of the
%%%                       segment.
%%%  * `music` is a music expression that defines the length of the
%%%            segment. The duration specified here will be the one
%%%            used to check for correctness the durations of all the
%%%            parts of the same segment.
%%%
\gridSetStructure 1
\with {
  lyrics = \lyricmode { Fa }
}
\relative c' {
  s1 |
}

%%% The `music` parameter may also include other commands, such as
%%% marks, tempo changes, bars, etc. You then have the possibility to
%%% include the structure above the staves, thus including the effects
%%% of these commands in the score.
\gridSetStructure 2
\with {
  lyrics = \lyricmode { la la la! }
}
\relative c' {
  \mark 1
  \tempo 4=120
  s1 | s1 |
}

\gridSetStructure 3
\relative c' {
  \mark 2
  s1 | s1 |
}

\gridSetStructure 4
\relative c' {
  \mark 3
  s1 | s1 \bar "|." |
}

%%% Entering music
%%% --------------
%%%
%%% Now we can start to enter the music! The interface of
%%% \gridPutMusic is the same of \gridSetStructure, with the
%%% additional parameter `part` that specifies the part you are
%%% working on.
%%%
\gridPutMusic "soprano" 1
\with {
  lyrics = \lyricmode { Fa la }
}
\relative c' {
  e2 f |
}

\gridPutMusic "soprano" 2
\with {
  lyrics = \lyricmode { li le lo lu la! }
}
\relative c' {
  f4 a g b | c1 |
}

%%% The context modifier is optional: if you skip it, defaults for
%%% `lyrics`, `opening` and `closing` are looked up in the structure
%%% for the given section.
\gridPutMusic "basso" 1
\relative c {
  \clef "bass"
  c1 |
}

\gridPutMusic "basso" 2
\relative c {
  f2 g | c,1 |
}

%%% Missing cells
%%% -------------
%%%
%%% As for missing cells, if there is structure defined for them (as
%%% in this example), then they will be replaced in the output by
%%% dummy cells, filled with skips. If the structure is not defined,
%%% then you will get an error.
%%%
%%% Here, for section 3 we are not defining any music. For section 4,
%%% we define only the soprano, so that you can see the effects of
%%% these undefined cells in the output (and in the printed grid as
%%% well)

\gridPutMusic "soprano" 4
\with {
  lyrics = \lyricmode {li le!}
}
\relative c'' {
  g1 | c |
}

%%% Display the grid
%%% ----------------
%%%
%%% With the following command you can print the current grid state,
%%% with `o` symbols marking entered segments and `-` symbols denoting
%%% missing segments.
\gridDisplay

%%% Checking the grid contents
%%% --------------------------
%%%
%%% The following command checks that, for each segment, each part of
%%% that segment has the same duration as the one specified in the
%%% structure for that segment. If not, it issues a warning on the
%%% console. If there is no structure specified for that segment
%%% (remember, structure specification is optional), then the function
%%% checks that all the parts have the same duration for that segment.
\gridCheck

%%% Music selection
%%% ---------------
%%%
%%% And now, let's see the functions that are used to get the music
%%% out of the grid. These functions are
%%%
%%%  - \gridGetStructure segment-selector
%%%  - \gridGetMusic part segment-selector
%%%  - \gridGetLyrics part segment-selector
%%%
%%% where
%%%
%%%  - `part` is the name of the part you want to get the music from
%%%  - `segment-selector` is either the symbol 'all, to get all the
%%%                       segments, or a tuple '(start . end) to get
%%%                       the segments from start up to end,
%%%                       inclusive.

%%% Optionally set the segment-range to either a pair or to a single segment.
%%% Uncomment one of the following lines to limit the compiled range:
%\gridSetRange #'(1 . 2)
%\gridSetRange 2
