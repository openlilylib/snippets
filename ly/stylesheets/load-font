%{
  Activate a font that is configured using \useNotationFont.
  Do not include this file directly, as it is called implicitly through
  the function. (This is why the file doesn't have an extension.)

  TODO:
  We are still looking for a way to avoid having to do this separate include.
  The problem is that inside the function we don't have access to the
  staff-height and pt variables
  => Ideas and solutions welcome!
