* add instructions on how to work with the repo
with something else than github's web interface

* add instructions for "uploading" png files

* add info about branching (when we will have some policy)

* decide on licensing

* document generate-pngs.sh

* mention some cool stuff that may not be obvious to some people:
    * that you can easily link to files and folders

Merge other useful lily repositories, for example:
* https://github.com/mwitmer/LyUtil
* https://github.com/jpvoigt/lalily
* orchestrallily
* i think that we should gather together various lilypond
  repositories under the banner of OpenLilyLib.  For example
  * https://github.com/dliessi/ports

* "input-shorthands" isn't a very good name either.
