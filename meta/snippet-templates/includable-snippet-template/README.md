Use this template for snippets that define custom commands, functions etc.
Place the snippet in its own directory in the appropriate category,
put all definitions in `.ily` file(s) and the usage example(s) in `.ly` file(s),
so that anyone interested in using the snippet could simply `\include` the `.ily` file.

If the snippet requires detailed explanations, place them in a `README.md` file
(like this one).  If you do this, write a short description in the `.ily` file as well.
Don't duplicate information from `README` or `.ily` files in the usage examples.
