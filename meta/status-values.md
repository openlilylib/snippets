"Incomplete" statuses
---------------------

In case of "incomplete" statuses, please provide a 'TODO'
comment below the status, listing what needs to be done.

**broken** - this snippet doesn't work with latest
LilyPond development version and needs upgrading.

**hack** - this code gets something done, but it's ugly and/or
wrong, and may do unexpected things.  It should be simplified
or rewritten;  it is not recommended to use it as an example
of LilyPond code.

**unfinished** - this snippet is a work-in-progress.

**unknown** - this snippet needs checking.  Maybe it's working
as desired, but maybe not.

**undocumented** - this snippet is missing description and/or
usage examples, but otherwise it is complete and working.


"Finished" statuses
-------------------

(every snippet should eventually reach one of these)

TODO: pick best name
**completed/done/ready/working/finished** - this snippet does what it is supposed to do.
It may be further improved in the future, but there is
nothing wrong with current code.

**buggy** - this snippet is finished (i.e. the code is
complete and it works), but there are known problems (for example
caused by LilyPond bugs).

**workaround** - this snippet is complete, but due to LilyPond
limitations and/or the nature of the problem, the solution is
flawed in some way (for example a notation element is 'faked').

**official** - this snippet represents Recommended LilyPond
Practice. The code is well-written and the solution is
logically and structurally correct (it's not a workaround).
It can be regarded as a good example of how things should be
done in LilyPond.
