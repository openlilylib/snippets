    Sometimes you want to change horizontal spacing relative to what
    LilyPond calculated by default.  You could do this by overriding
    common-shortest-duration property of the SpacingSpanner, but that
    requires some tial-and-error to figure out what values make the
    spacing tighter, and what values make it looser.  Additionally,
    this is different for different pieces - in one piece overriding
    common-shortest-duration to 1/8 may make the spacing looser than
    the default, but in another piece it may make the spacing tighter.

    This function allows you to adjust spacing without having to
    figure out anything.  Positive values make spacing looser,
    negative make it tighter, working similarly in any score.
    There are two predefined “shorthands”.

    This can also be used inside a "\layout" block.
