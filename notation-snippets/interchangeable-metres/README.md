###Interchangeable metres
In Behind bars p. 174 Gould turns to the topic of interchangeable metres.

>Use two time signatures for passages that interchange equivalent-beat 
simple- and compound-time metres either irregularly or simultaneosly.

She recommends three alternative time signatures for this: 
2/4 (6/8) or 2/4 / 6/8 or 2/4 = 6/8. (But what she actually uses in her
examples is the first.)

It was indeed the alternative with the parenthesis that first caught 
my attention. But after some more thought I find it potentially 
ambigous. I would rather use the parenthesis for e g a passage 
that is quite indiffent between 3/4 and 6/8.

I would instead recommend the use of the equal sign which I think is
the clearest of the three alternatives.

I don't think I'll find use for this myself therefore I leave it in an
unfinished state in the hope that someone will find something useful
in all this.
