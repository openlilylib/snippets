This is a place for posting stuff that isn't doing anything new,
just explains or demonstrates stuff that is already described in
the documentation.  In general, short snippets which don't use
custom scheme functions go here (using the one-file template).
Examples:
* [Adding ambitus per voice](http://lsr.dsi.unimi.it/LSR/Item?id=84),
* [Adding an extra staff](http://lsr.dsi.unimi.it/LSR/Item?id=110),
