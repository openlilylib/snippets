Are you answering an email on lilypond-user mailing list
with some code that looks like an ugly hack but it works?
Or maybe you think that your code is to specific to be of
general interest?

Add it here anyway.  Even if it really won't be usable to
other people, it could be an inspiration.  Or it could be
improved later.

In general, almost everything can be added here -- if you
think that your code is ugly or that the optimal solution
should be implemented differently, just mention this in
the description.
