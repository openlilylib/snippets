    When typesetting songs, you usually want to put additional stanzas
    below the music.
  }
  % add comma-separated tags to make searching more effective:
  tags = "stanza, stanzas, song, vocal music, centered, markup, fill-line"

  TODO:
  it would be good to turn this into a function.
  the function would take the number of columns to be used as an argument
  (i.e. does the user want to have all stanzas in one column, below each other,
  or should they be in two or more columns?)
  QUESTION for that: is there a converntion how the stanzas should be ordered?
  I.e. if we have 9 stanzas in 3x3 layout, are they placed like this
  1 4 7
  2 5 8
  3 6 9
  or
  1 2 3
  4 5 6
  7 8 9
  ?
  If we allow both arrangements, we would need a parameter for that.

  BUG: if columns have significantly differrent width, alignment is wrong.
